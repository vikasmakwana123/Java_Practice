how functions are stored in the memory 
the functions are stored in the memory in the form of stack and also the main function is the lowest and the first that would be stored in the stack after which the other functions would be stored on top of it and the varaibles in the functions would be stored in that block of the function in the stack once the function is performed the function returns would be removed from the stack
